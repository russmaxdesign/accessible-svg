# Accessible SVG

This page has been built to conduct a series of accessibility tests on embedded SVG files. The first two tests aim to determine the support for titles and descriptions within SVG files:

- **Test 1**: Are SVG titles and descriptions announced to Screen Readers when using line-by-line navigation?
- **Test 2**: Are SVG titles and descriptions announced to Screen Readers when using TAB key navigation?

The next test aim to determine the most well supported method for linking to alternate versions of SVG files.

- **Test 3**: Can users navigate to an alternate version via link associated with SVG

The last two tests aim to determine if linked SVG files can be made accessible to keyboard-only users

- **Test 4**: Is there a visual indicator when the users hovers over the linked SVG file (ie. change of color, cursor change)?
- **Test 5**: Is there a visual indicator when the users focuses over the linked SVG file?
